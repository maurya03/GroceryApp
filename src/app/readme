Advantages of using module and components:
> We can divide a page into various component and each component will seperately be handled. Inshort, component manageness,
maintenance, and distribution among members will be easy.
> modules can seperate the relevant and irrelevant information among modules. For example: Admin, User, and Partner
each module have some data which they don't want to share then they can do this using modules.
